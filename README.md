\section{Introduction}
	This paper deals with the construction of an AI player to play the game Othello. A lot of techniques are already known to let AI players play the game Othello. We will not try to improve on these techniques, but to use a completely different and very simple approach to play the game.
\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
	In this section, we will give some information about Artificial Intelligence. On the second Dartmouth Conference in 1956, organized by John MeCerthy, the name "Artificial Intelligence" was used first time. The first work in AI however started more than 10 years before the Dartmouth conference and was done by War- ren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. Chess was tackled by Konrad Zuse, Claude Shannon, Norbert Wiener and Alan Turing already in 1950. In 1956, a checkers was demonstrated by Arthur Samuel to be able to play at a strong amateur level.
\subsection{Beginning of the game}
	In our research, we consider the game Othello. This game was introduced in 1975. Few years later the game has changed its name to Reversi. This game got a lot of popularity in England in 1898.
\subsection{AI Othello}
In this paper, we developed an AI player that is capable of playing the game Othello. The human world champions were beaten by the best AI Othello players. We did not try to improve on the existing techniques, but investigated a different approach to play Othello. This different approach is the Monte Carlo algorithm. An advantage of the Monte Carlo algorithm is that it is fast and does not use any domain knowledge.
\subsection{Algorithm}
The Monte Carlo algorithm has many applications, also in the game field. For example, the algorithm has been used to play the game Go. Go is a very complex game that is very hard to tackle in AI.
